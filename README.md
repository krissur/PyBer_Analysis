# PyBer_Analysis
## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to summarize ride sharing data on Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities.  While also providing visual graphs that contribute insight into how the data differs per city type.
## Results
As you can see in the data below, the highest per ride fares are in the rural areas, however their total fares is substantially lower then the Urban total fares. You can surmise this is supply and demand surge rates due to less drivers. The Urban and Suburban have higher total overall fares due quick trips, more rides and a greater number of drivers available.

The following chart visualizes fares per city type over multiple months. As with the chart above, the Urban and Suburban generate the most income overall, while the Rural is significantly lower. 
However, all 3 city types, peak at the end of February and drop in the beginning of March. Additionally, all 3 fluctuate from one another in March and April. This could insinuate activities in the Urban areas such as festivals or other crowd generating events are producing more need for rides into the Urban areas during those time frames.

## Summary
My  recommendations  are as follows.
* Analyze on demand events from the past year in the Urban areas , i.e.: festivals, events, and holidays.
* Reanalyze the ride share data for that past year to verify the peak ride time match up with those events.
* Have more drivers available in the Rural areas during those peak times to generate more revenue.
